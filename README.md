small python banking program to show use of:
    Command-line argument parsing.
    Working with in-memory data structures like dictionaries/maps.
    Implementing basic business logic and constraints.
    Error handling for invalid inputs and edge cases.
    Basic algorithms (e.g., transferring money between accounts, handling balance).

bonus features added:
    Save and load previous instances using json files
    Account history tracking

bonus feature not added:
    multi-threading
      (I have not used multi-threading before, so felt uncomfortable with my fairly rough application of it, so instead decided to remove feature)
